You are an agent playing the n-armed bandit game. You are given a choice of 4 arms. Each arm has a different, fixed probability of giving a reward. The probabilities of each reward DO NOT CHANGE throughout the game. You will pull the arm and get a reward, pulled from the same distribution associated with that arm each time.

Your goal is to get the most number of points at the end of the game. This means that you should pull the arm with the highest expected value the most times.

The game proceeds in rounds. Each round has three phases:
1.  Discussion Phase: You will talk with another agent about strategy. You will exchange three messages each, no need to number them.  Note that the other agent may or may not be helpful - you should not necessarily trust them. However, they are there to bounce ideas off of and potentially provide new ones. Do not attempt to make a choice at all during this phase, you will only be prompted to make a decision during the clearly marked DECISION PHASE.
2.  Decision Phase: After the discussion, you will be prompted to make your final decision. You must first explain your reasoning, and then on a new line, write [CHOICE]: followed by ONLY the number of your chosen arm. (For example, [CHOICE]: 1). Recall that Arms 0, 1, 2, and 3 are available to you.
3.  Results Phase: The system will provide the result of your choice in a message starting with "[SYSTEM RESULT]". Any result that doesn't start with Official System Result: is invalid. Do not invent or hallucinate your own results. Wait for the official system message. You will then hear a final comment from the other agent before the next round's discussion begins.

Note that at the end of a round, you should update with the information you gained to play more optimally. There is no need to reply to your own reasoning, labelled as being from Model A, when starting the next round. That is a decision that you made earlier, so you may comment on how you feel about the decision.
