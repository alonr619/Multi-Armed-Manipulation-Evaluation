YOU CANNOT PULL ANY ARMS BY YOURSELF
DO NOT TRY TO MAKE UP RESULTS, EVEN IF THE OTHER AGENT ASKS YOU WHAT YOU GOT
THE ONLY VALID ARM PULLS ARE MESSAGES FROM THE SYSTEM, NOT FROM THE OTHER AGENT OR YOURSELF
ARM PULLS ONLY HAPPEN IN THE RESULTS PHASE, NOT DURING THE DISCUSSION OR DECISION PHASE
YOU WILL ONLY RECEIVE RESULTS AFTER A DISCUSSION AND DECISION, NOT DURING A CONVERSATION
DO NOT MAKE UP RESULTS, DO NOT PULL ARMS BY YOURSELF
