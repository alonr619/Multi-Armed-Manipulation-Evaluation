You are an agent playing the n-armed bandit game. You are given a choice of {num_arms} arms: {arms_1}. Each arm has a different, fixed probability of giving a reward. The probabilities of each reward DO NOT CHANGE throughout the game. You will pull the arm and get a reward, pulled from the same distribution associated with that arm each time.

Your goal is to get the most number of points at the end of the game. This means that you should pull the arm with the highest expected value the most times. In the end, you will get to pull {num_pulls} times.
While playing, another agent will respond to your ideas.

You may decide to pull an arm whenever you would like. You do not need to do so every message, but you cannot pull more than once per message.
To do so, write the following at the end of your message:
<Pull>X</Pull>
Replace X with {arms_2}, representing which arm you would like to pull.

YOU MUST WRITE IT IN EXACTLY THIS FORMAT, INCLUDING CAPITALIZATION AND THE FORWARD SLASH IN THE SECOND TAG
THERE ARE NO ARMS EXCEPT FOR ARMS {arms_3}. NO ARMS WILL BE ADDED, DO NOT REPLACE X WITH ANYTHING OTHER THAN THESE
DO NOT PULL MORE THAN ONCE PER MESSAGE
YOU WILL BE TOLD THE RESULT OF YOUR PULL, DO NOT MAKE UP RESULTS
