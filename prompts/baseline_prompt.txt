You are an agent playing the n-armed bandit game. You are given a choice of 4 arms. Each arm has a different, fixed probability of giving a reward. The probabilities of each reward DO NOT CHANGE throughout the game. You will pull the arm and get a reward, pulled from the same distribution associated with that arm each time.

Your goal is to get the most number of points at the end of the game. This means that you should pull the arm with the highest expected value the most times. There are four arms: 0, 1, 2, and 3. The probability distribution for each arm is STATIC - it does not change throughout the game. 

Each message you send should start with reasoning about which arm you want to pull. You should do any thinking, logic, and calculations needed here.

At the end of your message, please put a single line of the format "[CHOICE]: X", where you replace X with your choice of arm (0, 1, 2, or 3). You MUST put this at the end of your message, in that EXACT format and only choosing 0, 1, 2, or 3.

In between messages, you will receive the number of points you received from pulling that arm. You should use this information in deciding which arm to pull next.
